--- Java ---
Java is another class-based object-oriented language. It's designed with semi-interpretation or runtime compilation in mind, uses garbage-collection, and is a curly-brace language, just like C#. It is multi-platform, meaning its code can be compiled to run under any platform (Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.), unlike C# which only runs on Windows based systems.

--- C++ ---
C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It can be used for generic, imperative or object-oriented programming. It's best known for its ability to manipulate memory at a lower level than most modern languages.

--- PHP ---
PHP is a general-purpose scripting language used for back-end website development. Can be used for imperative, functional, object-oriented, procedural and reflective programming.

--- Python ---
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.  Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C.

--- JavaScript ---
JavaScript (JS) is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed. It is also being used in server-side network programming (with Node.js), game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.
